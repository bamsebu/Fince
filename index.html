          Environmental Communication (EC) can be approached in a variety of
          ways. This paper sets out to investigate the usefulness of different
          approaches in EC. By referring to examples in literature, the paper is
          limited to gain insights in two approaches or lenses; democracy and
          communication. The paper is designed to determine how democracy and
          communication based research contributes to investigation in EC. The
          first section describes and contrasts theories, concepts and
          methodologies, while the final section highlights weaknesses and
          strengths in the approaches. After the Second World War there was a
          rising wave of scholars who researched how totalitarian regimes came
          to dominate over established democratic systems, and how it could be
          refrained from happening again (Hansen, von Essen & Sriskandarajah
          2016, pp. 114-116). In this context, works of critical social theorist
          Jürgen Habermas became inevitable . As we shall see, Habermas’ work,
          such as the public sphere theory, is applicable to both the
          communication and democracy approach. The public sphere can best be
          described “as a network for communicating information and points of
          view […]” (Habermas 1996, p. 360). In research within the two
          approaches and EC, the theory is commonly used along with application
          of deliberative democracy. This form of democracy encompasses that
          people’s views should be represented equally and under conditions in
          which one can think and come to a considered judgement (Fishkin 2009,
          p. 13). The deliberative democracy is generally understood to be about
          participating, as well as how you participate. Within the two
          approaches, it is especially difficult to bypass conceptualization of
          the deliberative democracy in the democracy approach. Furthermore,
          according to Hansen et al. (2016), due to neoliberal ideology’s
          dominance in problem management, the deliberative democracy is being
          eroded. Neoliberal ideology refers to the logic of letting the market
          steer society, even at the expense of democracy. Still, there are no
          convincing arguments that technocratic solutions can solve problems
          without a living
